	 ======Exception Handling=========
	Exception and Error ----> Throwable is main class for all exception
Exception: An unwanted unexpected event that disturbs normal flow of the program is called

It is highly recommended to handle exceptions. The main objective of exception
handling is graceful (normal) termination of the program.

Within the try block if anywhere an exception raised then rest of the try block wonâ€™t
be executed even though we handled that exception
 length of the try block should be as less as possible.
