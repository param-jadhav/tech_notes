connect sys as sysdba;

SELECT * FROM all_users;

SELECT * FROM all_users ORDER BY created;

CREATE USER ies IDENTIFIED BY ies;

Assigning Privileges:-
We also need to ensure our new user has disk space allocated in the system to actually create or modify tables and data, so weâ€™ll GRANT TABLESPACE like so:
GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO books_admin;

GRANT CREATE SESSION GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE TO books_admin; or  grant create session to ies;
Table Privileges:-
While not typically necessary in newer versions of Oracle, some older installations may require that you manually specify the access rights the new user has to a specific schema and database tables.

For example, if we want our books_admin user to have the ability to perform SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE capabilities on the books table, we might execute the following GRANT statement:

GRANT
  SELECT,
  INSERT,
  
  UPDATE,
  DELETE
ON
  schema.ies
TO
  books_admin;
